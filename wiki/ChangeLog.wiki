#summary Version-to-version changes

=== Next Version ===

  * New `SQLiteQueue` and `SQLiteJob` classes - a job queue implementation for accessing single-threaded SQLite connection in a multi-threaded or GUI application ([http://code.google.com/p/sqlite4java/issues/detail?id=3 #3]).
  * `SQLiteConnection.dispose()` method contract changed: it is now not allowed to call dispose from a different (non-confining) thread, due to possible JVM crash ([http://code.google.com/p/sqlite4java/issues/detail?id=18 #18]). If called from different thread, the method will fail softly.
  * New `SQLiteConnection.getOpenFlags()` method return the flags that were used to open the connection.
